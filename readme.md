Weather refers to the atmospheric conditions in a specific place at a particular time. 
It encompasses various elements such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, 
atmospheric pressure, and cloud cover. Weather conditions are influenced by factors like the Earth's rotation, 
the sun's radiation, air masses, and geographical features. Weather forecasts are predictions made 
by meteorologists using data from weather stations, satellites, radar systems, and computer models 
to provide information about expected weather conditions in the near future, helping people 
to plan activities and make informed decisions.
